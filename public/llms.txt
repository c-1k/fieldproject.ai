# Field Project — Architecture as Counter-Force to Entropy

> Field Project is an architecture for event-driven systems where every event passes through a governed pipeline of ingress, decisioning, policy evaluation, execution, and audit — each responsibility isolated in a named service modeled after a physics particle.

## Particles

- **Boson** — Ingress & Canonicalization: accepts inputs, validates identity, wraps into EventEnvelope
- **Fermion** — Decisioning & Orchestration: evaluates pipelines, produces ActionPlans
- **Higgs** — Governance Brain: owns tenant config, evaluates policy (allow/deny/filter)
- **Hadron** — Durability & State Machines: durable job store, step state machines
- **Photon** — Connectors & Egress: typed connectors to external systems
- **Neutrino** — Audit & Observability: append-only audit ledger, decision traces
- **Quark** — Domain Objects: parses raw payloads into typed domain events
- **Gluon** — Workflow Composition: workflow graph/DSL, branching, fan-out
- **Graviton** — Time & Scheduling: cron triggers, delays, SLA timers
- **Muon** — Sandbox Execution: safe execution of user-defined transforms

## Canonical Flow

Boson → Fermion → Higgs (policy) → Photon (execute) → Neutrino (audit)
Hadron provides durable state. Quark types payloads. Gluon composes workflows.

## The 12 Laws of the Field

1. Policy Before Execution
2. Decisioning Is Separate from Execution
3. Observability Must Not Mutate Outcomes
4. Events Are Immutable After Canonicalization
5. Side Effects Must Be Declared, Typed, and Auditable
6. Replay Must Be Safe and Deterministic
7. Tenant Isolation at Every Layer
8. Configuration Is Externalized
9. Boundaries Are Explicit and Enforced
10. Deny by Default
11. Build Only the Missing Layer
12. Entropy Increases by Default
