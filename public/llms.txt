# Turf — Multi-Agent Coordination

> Turf is a CLI tool that coordinates AI coding agents working in parallel on the same codebase. It prevents file conflicts through scope leasing, isolates agents in separate git worktrees, and merges their work through an ordered queue. Install: `npm install @c-1k/turf`

## Core Concepts

- [Scope Leasing](https://github.com/c-1k/fermion/blob/main/docs/GOVERNANCE.md): TTL-based file ownership via glob patterns
- [Workspace Isolation](https://github.com/c-1k/fermion/blob/main/docs/API-REFERENCE.md#workspace): Isolated git worktrees per agent
- [Merge Queue](https://github.com/c-1k/fermion/blob/main/docs/DAEMON.md): Ordered integration pipeline
- [Hooks](https://github.com/c-1k/fermion/blob/main/docs/HOOKS.md): Pre-commit scope enforcement
