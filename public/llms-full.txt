# Field Project — Architecture as Counter-Force to Entropy
# Full Reference for LLMs

## Elevator Definition

Field Project is an architecture for event-driven systems where every event
passes through a governed pipeline of ingress, decisioning, policy evaluation,
execution, and audit — each responsibility isolated in a named service modeled
after a physics particle.

The particle metaphor is not decorative: each name encodes what the service does
and, critically, what it must never do, making architectural violations legible
by analogy. The "field" is the processing space governed by invariant laws that
no single service can override.

## The 10 Particles

### 1. Boson — Ingress & Canonicalization

- **Physics analog:** Force carrier — mediates the interaction between external
  inputs and the internal field
- **Role:** Accepts inputs from any source (webhook, queue, API call), validates
  caller identity, normalizes the payload, and wraps it into an EventEnvelope
  with a unique correlation ID, timestamp, and tenant context
- **Outputs:** EventEnvelope (canonical event format for the field)
- **Must never:** Make decisions about what happens to the event, execute side
  effects, or drop events silently

### 2. Fermion — Decisioning & Orchestration

- **Physics analog:** Matter particle — the substance of computation, subject to
  the exclusion principle (one decision per event)
- **Role:** Receives an EventEnvelope, evaluates it against configured pipeline
  rules, and produces an ActionPlan describing what should happen — without
  executing anything
- **Outputs:** ActionPlan (ordered list of declared intentions)
- **Must never:** Execute side effects directly, bypass policy evaluation, or
  modify the original event

### 3. Higgs — Governance Brain

- **Physics analog:** Higgs field — gives mass (authority) to other particles,
  determining which actions are permitted
- **Role:** Owns tenant configuration, policy rules, and feature flags. Evaluates
  every ActionPlan against policy before execution. Returns allow, deny, or
  filter verdicts
- **Outputs:** PolicyVerdict (allow/deny/filter with audit metadata)
- **Must never:** Execute actions itself, store event data, or be bypassed by
  any other particle

### 4. Hadron — Durability & State Machines

- **Physics analog:** Composite particle — bound state that persists, providing
  structure and memory
- **Role:** Provides durable job storage, step-level state machines, and
  checkpoint/resume capabilities. Ensures long-running workflows survive
  process restarts
- **Outputs:** JobState, checkpoint records, resume tokens
- **Must never:** Make decisions about event routing, execute external side
  effects, or violate state machine transition rules

### 5. Photon — Connectors & Egress

- **Physics analog:** Photon — carries energy (effects) to the outside world
- **Role:** Typed connectors to external systems (APIs, databases, message
  queues, email, SMS). Executes the declared side effects from an approved
  ActionPlan
- **Outputs:** ExecutionReceipt (success/failure with external system response)
- **Must never:** Decide which actions to take (only executes approved plans),
  modify event data, or operate without an approved PolicyVerdict

### 6. Neutrino — Audit & Observability

- **Physics analog:** Neutrino — passes through everything, observes without
  interacting, nearly impossible to block
- **Role:** Append-only audit ledger recording every decision, policy evaluation,
  execution result, and state transition. Provides decision traces for
  debugging and compliance
- **Outputs:** AuditEntry, DecisionTrace, compliance reports
- **Must never:** Mutate outcomes, block or delay the pipeline, or be disabled
  by any other particle

### 7. Quark — Domain Objects

- **Physics analog:** Quark — fundamental building block, never observed in
  isolation, always part of a larger structure
- **Role:** Parses raw payloads into strongly typed domain events. Provides
  schema validation, version negotiation, and type coercion
- **Outputs:** Typed domain events (e.g., OrderCreated, PaymentReceived)
- **Must never:** Make routing decisions, execute side effects, or accept
  invalid payloads without error

### 8. Gluon — Workflow Composition

- **Physics analog:** Gluon — binds quarks together into hadrons, mediating
  the strong force between workflow steps
- **Role:** Workflow graph definition and DSL. Handles branching, fan-out,
  fan-in, conditional steps, and parallel execution paths
- **Outputs:** WorkflowGraph (DAG of steps with edges and conditions)
- **Must never:** Execute steps directly, bypass policy checks on individual
  steps, or create cycles in the workflow graph

### 9. Graviton — Time & Scheduling

- **Physics analog:** Graviton — mediates gravitational force, bending the
  fabric of spacetime (event timing)
- **Role:** Cron triggers, one-time scheduled events, delays, SLA timers,
  and timeout enforcement. Injects time-based events into the field
- **Outputs:** ScheduledEvent, TimerExpiry, SLABreach notifications
- **Must never:** Make decisions about event content, execute side effects
  directly, or silently drop scheduled events

### 10. Muon — Sandbox Execution

- **Physics analog:** Muon — heavier cousin of the electron, exists briefly
  in a contained environment before decaying
- **Role:** Safe, isolated execution of user-defined transforms, filters,
  and custom logic. Runs in sandboxed environments with resource limits
  and timeout enforcement
- **Outputs:** TransformResult (transformed data or error)
- **Must never:** Access resources outside its sandbox, execute without
  resource limits, or persist state beyond its execution scope

## Canonical Flow

The primary event processing pipeline:

```
Boson → Fermion → Higgs (policy) → Photon (execute) → Neutrino (audit)
```

Supporting particles provide cross-cutting capabilities:
- **Hadron** provides durable state and checkpointing at every stage
- **Quark** types payloads between Boson and Fermion
- **Gluon** composes multi-step workflows within Fermion
- **Graviton** injects time-based triggers into the pipeline via Boson
- **Muon** executes user-defined transforms within sandboxed boundaries

*Muon executes only within a sandbox, never against external systems.

Each particle has exactly one primary responsibility. No particle may assume
another's role. This is enforced by the 12 Laws.

## The 12 Laws of the Field

### Law 1 — Policy Before Execution
**Statement:** No side effect may execute without prior policy evaluation.
**Rationale:** Every action must pass through Higgs before Photon can execute it.
This ensures governance is structural, not optional. If policy evaluation fails
or is unavailable, the pipeline halts — it never proceeds optimistically.

### Law 2 — Decisioning Is Separate from Execution
**Statement:** The particle that decides what to do must never be the particle
that does it.
**Rationale:** Fermion produces ActionPlans; Photon executes them. This
separation makes every decision auditable and every execution traceable to an
explicit decision. It prevents "smart connectors" that make invisible choices.

### Law 3 — Observability Must Not Mutate Outcomes
**Statement:** Audit and observability must be append-only and must never alter
pipeline behavior.
**Rationale:** Neutrino records everything but changes nothing. If observability
could affect outcomes, the system would be unreliable under monitoring changes —
a violation of determinism.

### Law 4 — Events Are Immutable After Canonicalization
**Statement:** Once Boson wraps a payload into an EventEnvelope, no particle may
modify its content.
**Rationale:** Immutability guarantees that every particle downstream sees the
same event. Without this, replay becomes non-deterministic and audit trails
become unreliable.

### Law 5 — Side Effects Must Be Declared, Typed, and Auditable
**Statement:** Every side effect must appear as a declared intention in the
ActionPlan, with a typed schema, before execution.
**Rationale:** No hidden effects. If it is not in the plan, it does not happen.
This makes the system's behavior fully inspectable before any external system
is contacted.

### Law 6 — Replay Must Be Safe and Deterministic
**Statement:** Re-processing any event through the pipeline must produce the
same decisions and, with idempotent connectors, the same outcomes.
**Rationale:** Systems fail. Networks partition. Replay is not exceptional — it
is the normal recovery mechanism. Determinism ensures replay does not create
duplicate side effects or contradictory state.

### Law 7 — Tenant Isolation at Every Layer
**Statement:** No tenant's data, configuration, or execution may leak into or
affect another tenant's processing.
**Rationale:** Multi-tenancy is a core architectural concern, not an application
feature. Isolation is enforced at ingress (Boson), policy (Higgs), state
(Hadron), execution (Photon), and audit (Neutrino).

### Law 8 — Configuration Is Externalized
**Statement:** All behavior-altering configuration must live in Higgs, not in
application code or environment variables scattered across services.
**Rationale:** Centralized configuration makes the system's behavior auditable
and changeable without redeployment. It prevents "configuration drift" where
different services disagree on behavioral parameters.

### Law 9 — Boundaries Are Explicit and Enforced
**Statement:** Every particle declares its inputs, outputs, and invariants.
Cross-boundary calls must go through typed interfaces.
**Rationale:** Explicit boundaries prevent the "big ball of mud" failure mode.
When boundaries are enforced, violations are compile-time or deploy-time errors,
not runtime surprises.

### Law 10 — Deny by Default
**Statement:** Any action, event, or configuration not explicitly permitted by
policy is denied.
**Rationale:** Allowlisting is safer than denylisting. New event types, new
action types, and new integrations must be explicitly enabled in Higgs policy
before they can execute. This prevents accidental exposure.

### Law 11 — Build Only the Missing Layer
**Statement:** Field exists only where other systems stop. If an existing layer
can already solve the problem cleanly, Field must not duplicate it.
**Rationale:** Architectural discipline means knowing what NOT to build. Every
unnecessary layer adds entropy. Before proposing a new particle or capability,
ask: does something that already exists handle this? If yes, integrate.

### Law 12 — Entropy Increases by Default
**Statement:** Without active governance, every system trends toward disorder —
tangled dependencies, invisible side effects, untraceable decisions.
**Rationale:** This is the foundational law. Field exists as a counter-force to
entropy. The architecture, the particle boundaries, the laws themselves — all
exist because without them, systems decay. Governance is not overhead; it is the
only thing standing between order and chaos.

## The Two Endgames

Every system, at sufficient scale, converges on one of two outcomes:

**Endgame A — Entropy wins.** The system becomes a tangle of undocumented side
effects, invisible decisions, and configuration scattered across dozens of
services. No one can explain what happens when an event enters the system.
Debugging requires archaeology. Changes require courage.

**Endgame B — The Field holds.** Every event has a trace. Every decision has an
author. Every side effect was declared before it executed. The system is not
simple — but it is legible. New team members can follow an event from ingress
to audit and understand every step. The architecture resists entropy not by
preventing change, but by making change visible and governed.

Field Project is a bet on Endgame B.
